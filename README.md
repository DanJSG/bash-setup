# Bash Setup
Simple setup shell script used to set up a local Debian environment with all the tools I need to start working on projects.

Simply run using ```./setup.sh``` from the terminal. Don't run this script using sudo; the commands within the script use sudo. This ensures that the commands are run as the superuser but that it remains using the user's home directories.
